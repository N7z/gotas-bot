# ‚öôÔ∏è How to use
Create a `cookies.json` file and add the "s" cookies from your Wplace account in the following format:
```json
[
  "xfSAFZ5xsX38gdRS_8xnlg%3D%3D" // this cookie doesn't exist, btw
]
```
Create a `.env` file with your Discord webhook URL:

```env
DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL="https://webhooklink"
```

# Run the bot:
```bash
node index.js
```

And that's it, the boys are online
